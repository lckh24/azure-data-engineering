# Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Real-Time Project  
This project simulates a data engineering pipeline for a fictional business case, created as a learning tool to deepen my understanding of data workflows.  
## Problem statement and Business Request  
Agricultural sector plays a critical role in the nation's economy and food security. However, the lack of timely, accessible, and actionable insights into daily market prices of agricultural products creates significant challenges for farmers, policymakers, and supply chain stakeholders. Without a clear understanding of pricing trends, regional market dynamics, and product-level fluctuations, it becomes difficult to make informed decisions related to harvesting, distribution, procurement, and policy planning.  
## Project Overview   
To address this, we suggest a cloud-based data engineering pipeline that automates the collection, processing, and storage of market price data. This ensures that clean, ready-to-use data is available daily to support downstream use cases such as machine learning forecasting models and business analytics, enabling stakeholders to plan, operate, and respond more effectively to market dynamics.   
## Technologies Used  
* **Azure Databricks**:
* **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: For storing raw and processed data.
